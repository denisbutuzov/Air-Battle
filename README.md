### Documentation

Documentation is written in Russian language.

To build it you need Doxygen **v.1.8.0** or later. You can download it from the [official website](http://www.doxygen.nl/).

If you downloaded and installed it you can perform the following steps:
1. Go to *Space-Battle directory*:
```
cd ~/Space-Battle/
```

2. Run *Doxygen* with *conf_doc*:
```
doxygen conf_doc
```

Now in the *~/Space-Battle/doc* directory you can see documentation, which was created by Doxygen system.
